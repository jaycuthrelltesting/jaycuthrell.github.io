## Summary

I am a proud team member of a global IT products business grown from zero to multi-billion dollar annual run rates. Previously, I formed my own consulting practice to deliver trusted advisory support to service providers, investment groups, and startup companies. Additionally, I have held CTO, VP, and GM roles in rapid growth ICT companies in North America. My years in a global consulting practice gave me the chance to work both domestically and internationally with Fortune 500 and .com companies after working in large global ICT product companies.

As indicated in my [speaker bio](/), I am a technology strategist and business leader possessing tactician chops to back it up... and the frequent flier miles to show for it. My professional life is marked with senior roles at companies where I straddle the line of development, operations, and rewarding travel to both close business and revisit my customers as their trusted advisor. I have grown and developed high potential teams of software, systems, product, services, and sales engineers along the way.
