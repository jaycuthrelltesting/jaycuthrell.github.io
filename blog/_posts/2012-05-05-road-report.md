Life moves pretty fast when you are traveling for work. I've come back from each trip to learn that the VCE RTP office is growing by leaps and bounds.

My last trip took me to the VCE Boston office for a customer meeting and EBC.

Since taking a global role I've been spending a lot of time meeting with customers around the world. Sometimes that involves travel and using Cisco TelePresence. The use of Cisco TelePresence is a lot less wear and tear on your life and I've been fortunate enough to enjoy such global sessions with Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney, etcâ€¦ and back in the US it makes it easy to be everywhere and anywhere at just about anytime people are awake.

I'm very fortunate to be working for VCE at a crucial time in the growth of the company. It's good to take a step back and look at where you've been and look ahead to where you will be.

Here are few of the photos I've snapped while visiting Singapore, Tokyo, London, and Sydney.

In between these trips I've been all over the US too and it's only May.

I hope to visit with customers in Brazil and Israel later this year. It's been 10 years since I've been back to both but I'm looking forward to seeing Rio and Tel Aviv again soon.
