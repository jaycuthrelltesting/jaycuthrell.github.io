A few days ago I took almost all of my primary Twitter output since 2007.

I made archives well in advance and wanted to revisit some prior analysis.

I started looking around on GitHub for inspiration. 

A few years ago I did a big data presentation. There is even a video of it.

At the time, I had downloaded some R examples to run against my Twitter arcives.

I included some of these references in the presentation.

This time around I found another example using Python:

A few seconds later... this caught my eye:
