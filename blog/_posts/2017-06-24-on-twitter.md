A few days ago I removed almost all of my primary Twitter output since 2007.

First, I made archives well in advance in order to revisit some prior analysis.

Next, I started looking around on GitHub for inspiration. 

Little Big Data
===============

A few years ago I did a big data presentation. There is even a video of it.

At the time, I had downloaded some R examples to run against my Twitter archives.

Why archives? I tweet(ed) a lot. So, the limitations on web access applied.

I included some of these references in the presentation.

Trends: @Qthrul
===============

This time around I found another example using Python:

A few seconds later... this caught my eye for @Qthrul:

It is clear that functionality arrived (retweet) and that I was interactive
(replies).

Trends: @JayCuthrell and @JayAtDellEMC
======================================

But I had also created other Twitter accounts. 

Let's take a look at @JayCuthrell:
