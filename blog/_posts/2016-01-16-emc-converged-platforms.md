2015 was [a whirlwind](/blog/my-fifth-year-at-vce/) just as the past five years have been since I joined VCE.

That's a good thing.

Expect and Embrace Change
-------------------------

I was told early on to expect and embrace change.

The [announcements made by VCE](http://www.vce.com/about/media/news?id=tcm:20-36801) for 2016 are a great example of that change I was told about back in 2010. So years later as I reflect on the change and think about my role evolving along with the company it occured to me that I am both expecting and embracing change.

Yesterday, I had the chance to present to a wider group within Federation. One of the requrests from the facilitator was to include a slide that would introduce you, the speaker. This was up to the speaker of course as some folks will have head shots and others might have the original photo from their first badge with the company. 

Not everyone has an updated photo. I don't either but I had my levity inducing slide from before and used it. The reason for the request is because, like many presentations, the audience is attending via WebEx. Sometimes putting a face with a voice over a network based presentation can help make for a more human presenation.

Of course, I updated my template but this was the gist. Then something happened.

My chat lit up. There were a bunch of folks that were ex-Nortel on the WebEx. Smalllllll world!!!!

That got me thinking. This was my first presentation with my new title and new role.

My new title is Director of Technology Strategy. I'm on a team within the Global Office of the CTO at VCE, the Converged Platforms Division of EMC. Or, for short, EMC Converged Platforms.

Anyway, marketing and branding aside, putting up a photo that wasn't just a headshot but a picture of the past and today (well, technically a sort of recently updated photo) was more than levity inducing. It connected me to an audience. We had something in common other than being at the same company today and discussing [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] as it relates to the next phase in VCE 3.0 technology strategy.

The Path Ahead
--------------

The take away for me is that you can change the names, you can alter the branding, and you can even change directions. What is important is that you expect and embrace change. What was true in 2010 is true for 2016 and beyond.

I stopped making New Year's Resoltions years ago. I think you can expect and embrace change when you decide to make change real and personal for you. An arbitrary date on a calendar isn't a requirement. So, while others enjoy them and I enjoy hearing and seeing others mark their yearly change -- I'm equally happy to pick any day in a year.

So, here is to 2016. Here is to change in every way that I can expect and embrace. Here is to change that I purposfully seek out and realize in my new role. Here is to finding moments to reflect upon change.

One area of change will be in the publishing of content. I'm going to partner up and get a podcast going in 2016. It will probably involve blog posts too. For now, the bumper is simple and gives me a chance to use some of my own [music](/music/). Initially, topics will be related to the company or at the very least the technology ecosystem that is undergoing... change.

The website and postcast is simply called [Unicorn Jockeys](http://unicornjockeys.com/). It's empty now but it will fill out as the year progresses. Listeners can expect conversations about convergence, cloud, IT, data centers, transformation, and all things in between.

For 2016, I'm going to be looking at ways to discuss [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] as it relates to the next phase in VCE 3.0 technology strategy on this blog or at a suitable company blog outlet. I've created far more content behind the firewall from 2010-2015 and I'm looking forward to 2016 as a departure from purely internal publishing. We shall see.

And now...

Please see my [disclosure](/disclosure). I'll do my best to make sure the content of my blog posts that mention work at the very least have slightly more words than the boilerplate I'm pasting below from the bottom of [Chad's post](http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/virtual_geek/2016/01/platforms-end-game-for-it.html). 

And now... the obligatory appending of text!
