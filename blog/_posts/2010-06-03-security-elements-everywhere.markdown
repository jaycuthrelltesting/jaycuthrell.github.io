_Diclosure: [I donated to Diaspora](http://blippy.com/t/kagl)._







I've been asked the same question a few times these past few weeks




**So, Jay... What would it take for you to **[**come back to Facebook**](http://fudge.org/its-complicated/)**?**




It's a valid question.  Sure.  Let's work through this as a mental exercise.  In fact, I did just that.  I thought long and hard about it.  What would Facebook have to show me to regain my trust?




Then I realized I answered this question back in December of 2009 [at GigaOM](http://gigaom.com/2009/12/27/facebook-redesign/#comment-993127) and again in January 2010 over [at TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/12/ok-you-luddites-time-to-chill-on-facebook-over-privacy/#IDComment72996686).  So, here's what I was saying then (pasted from the comments sections):

> _Also, in the wake of the recent FB privacy change [1], no pushing of  the live feed to the left/right/top/bottom changes the damage inflicted  to any perceived trust of the FB platform. FB as a place for friends is a  far away reach.  Regression testing must be really, uh, hard.  As a  result, FB reserves the right to just dump everything about you into a  search engine somewhere as part of “progress” or so-called iterative  design improvements._

If you have an hour to spare... watch this video.  This was the talk that helped launch young minds thinking about where the Internet is headed.
