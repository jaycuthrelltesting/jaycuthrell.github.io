Six years! That's right. I've been at VCE for six years as of this update. To
understand the nuance of VCE it is important to think about the history of VCE
and just how far we have come... and where we are going.

The Moment
==========

There was a moment in 2015 when I knew this blog would become a bit
more vague than usual. I remember wondering how the VCE brand would be viewed in
a few months and in a few years. 

And yet... I was thankful.

you tech pundits &amp; FUD slingers that said @VCE is &#39;doomed&#39; in 2009,

Where Do We Go Now
==================

Today, it is pretty [hard to find a VCE logo](http://jaycuthrell.com/dell-emc-converged-platforms-and-solutions/). Sure, it is still referenced in a
lot of places on the Internet but the current brand is Dell EMC. Then again, if
you try to find the original Acadia logo that can be even harder to find.

[![Dell EMC](/images/dell-emc-logo-text.png "Dell EMC")](http://vce.com)

In terms of naming, the progression so far has been:

- Virtual Computing Environment Coalition
- Acadia
- VCE
- EMC Converged Platforms Division (CPD)
- EMC Converged Platforms and Solutions (CPSD)
- Dell EMC CPSD

Will VCE ever come back as a brand? I don't know.

Does the VCE brand matter? I don't know... but I do know a few things:

- At trade shows, folks pose next to _what_ VCE makes
- Customers pose next to their Vblock(s)
- Customers pose next to their VxBlock(s)
- Customers pose next to their VxRack(s)
- Customers pose next to their VxRail(s)
- VCE branded panels were not as popular as Vblock and VxBlock panels
- Vblock, VxBlock, VxRack, and VxRail are just plain *iconic* 

Vblock, VxBlock, VxRack, and VxRail
===================================

[![Vblock](/images/Vblock_300_FX.jpg "Vblock")](http://vce.com)

Vblock and VxBlock are huge and the fervor for VxRack and VxRail are off to an
agressive (and quite young) start that is amazing.

What Do I Do Without You
========================

I have donated a lot of my VCE attire. I have a few random swag items from trade
shows that have a VCE logo on them. Otherwise, I've got my Dell EMC shirts and
have gotten a lot of my branded gear moved to the new look and feel.

Oddly enough, I still haven't gotten new business cards. The only thing that's
still accurate on them is a couple of phone numbers.

Oh. That's right.

In my road warrior movements I managed to relocate to Austin, Texas.

Las Vegas was fun but there is a lot to do. There are people to connect. There
are many things to be done. There are lots of new firehoses to sip from for the
first time. Besides, I'll be visiting Las Vegas for all the big shows to meet
with customers, analysts, and catch up with peers from around the world.

In many ways, I've seemed to move every few years for this company just as the
name or the ownership percentages or logos have changed. But one thing that
hasn't changed is the goal.

What Comes Next
===============

To be clear, I don't know what I'll publish on this blog for 2016 and for 2017.
One of my projects for 2016 was to kick off a podcast but even that was put on
the backburner. Lot of things came up that needed careful attention. Things were
good and things were just the kind of fun that I signed up for back in 2010 and
getting to revisit some familiar topics with the sheer size and power of Dell
EMC is truly something to savor. So, the podcast has to wait.

What comes next will be big. Big might not mean in terms of deterministic power,
weight, cooling, and geometry terms. Big might mean big ideas. Big might mean
big moonshot sized audacious grabbing for the sky. Big will absolutely be a big
deal.
