[A growing number of companies are using FreshBooks as an alternative to desktop and client/server oriented billing systems.  The FreshBooks service sends email invoices and other communications on behalf of the company to the company's clients by making use of an email address and corresponding domain name for the company.

By contrast to the previous article regarding [BlackBerry Internet Service](http://fudge.org/blackberry-spf-records), the method for augmenting your own SPF record for using [FreshBooks is much more succinct](http://www.freshbooks.com/blog/2008/09/09/freshbooks-now-supports-spf/).
