_Cardio and diet make for a washboard abs villain._

That’s right. Software is a villain that wants great abs.

You’ve probably heard various “eat” neologisms if you spend any amount of time
on the Internet. That’s right! Things “eat” other things!

It’s zoomorphism anthropomorphism concatenation time!

One example from our recent Western society / post .com / post microwave / on
demand / immediate gratification era concerns how software will “eat” entire
planets to sustain itself. Whoa. How exciting!

Or, perhaps you’re old enough to remember the 1980s and have heard the one about
how culture will “eat” strategy after intermittent fasting. Summer approaches
and it’s all about fitting into that corporate swimsuit!

Software is actually a Galactus-style entity that consumes entire planets. As
such, the world is a great anytime snack that is literally packed with just
about everything that a Marvel universe villain needs.

Culture uses caloric restriction across time bounded intervals to promote fat
loss and improve insulin resistance. Strategy is an essential part of a balanced
ketogenic diet. Culture is already active enough to operate at a caloric deficit
and will most likely have really great abs just in time for summer. Watch those
macros!
