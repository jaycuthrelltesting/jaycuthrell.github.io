This post might make some analysts' heads explode and perhaps too in the land of the tech blogosphere but here goes...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>For a limited time you can be part of history by incrementing database rows for OpenStack Foundation Board nominations <a href="https://t.co/1tvTdHkr" title="https://www.openstack.org/members/checkNomination/2943">openstack.org/members/checkN…</a></p>&mdash; Jay Cuthrell (@Qthrul) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qthrul/status/232535832504983552">August 6, 2012</a></blockquote>

Last week I received the minimum 10 nominations (including my own self-nomination) from Individual Members of the OpenStack Foundation to be considered as a candidate for the 2012 Individual Director elections for the OpenStack Board of Directors. Voting takes place over the course of 5 days August 20, 2012 to August 24, 2012.

Below are the standard question list **responses** I've provided back to [Jonathan Bryce](https://twitter.com/jbryce). Jonathan is someone who I don't think I have talked to since [Interop for Rackspace's King of the Apps judging at House of Blues](http://fudge.org/king-of-the-apps/) last year.

Here't the thing... I'm not unique from anyone else in the industry in that I know a lot of Rackers and other folks involved in the OpenStack community. In my case this even goes back to folks that know me from my college days... that assure me I'll never hold public office. I digress... ;-)

Okay -- my **responses**: Enjoy!


> 1) What is your relationship to OpenStack, and why is its success important to you and/or your company? What would you say is your biggest contribution to OpenStack's success to date?


**I am a complete outsider to OpenStack but a fairer statement might be to say that I am a complete outside admirer. That said, I'm committed to the success of any innovation that furthers progress in converged infrastructure and especially in areas relating to management and orchestration ecosystems. I view management and orchestration ecosystems as being inclusive of formal ISV's or in the case of OpenStack, community driven endeavors. Within OpenStack I see the promise of what is possible to accelerate timelines towards that end with the management and orchestration ecosystem for Vblock™ Systems. My contributions to OpenStack in the future -- regardless of potential board involvement -- will be to assist the OpenStack community in that manner.**


> 2) Describe your experience with other non profits or serving as a board member. How does your experience prepare you for the role of a board member?


**I have contributed both time and monetarily to non profits and community driven endeavors and those disclosures are represented in the disclosure portion of my blog. My experience as a board member has been limited to customer advisory boards and technical advisory boards of commercial entities and those disclosures are also represented in the disclosure portion of my blog. I view the OpenStack Board of Directors as an opportunity to contribute my time and energies for the benefit of the OpenStack community.**


> 3) What do you see as the Board's role in OpenStack's success?


**The OpenStack Board of Directors role in the success of OpenStack should center upon organizational concerns to identify, support, and provide succession planning for the core leadership team (the Office) for the OpenStack community. While any Board of Directors role discussion would include governance, for the sake of brevity, the Board's role is to put the interests of the OpenStack community above their own.**


> 4) What do you think the top priority of the Board should be during the OpenStack Foundation's first year?


**The top priority of the OpenStack Board of Directors should be establishing the core leadership team (the Office) for OpenStack and set timelines and appropriate bylaws to support and ensure sustainable succession planning.**

So that's me and my poing of view in a nutshell. If you are reading this and are part of the OpenStack community -- please do vote even if it isn't for me.

Progress comes in many forms but it rarely stems from a posture of apathy and the status quo. To that end I've been attempting to make progress on this blog. I can't imagine why...
