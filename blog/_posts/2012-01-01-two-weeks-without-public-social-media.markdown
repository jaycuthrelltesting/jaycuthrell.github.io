Hello 2012. Let's rip the cover off this one!




Today begins my two week experiment of life without public social media.




**Say what!??**




No Twitter. No Foursquare. No Google Plus. No Instagram. No Path. No Linkedin. No Tumblr. No Flipboard. No Flickr. No YouTube. No TinyReview. No LiveJournal. No Diaspora. No… you get the picture.




(I'm not leaving Facebook out… I just don't use it.)

**Okay. Now what?**




Instead of using public social media resources, I'll be focused on 100% behind the corporate firewall(s), CIDR restricted, Shib/PL/RSA/etc. protected and otherwise Enterprise only class forms of private and hybrid social media.




What I've noticed now that I get to interact daily with a _decidedly non-public facing non-publically consumable stream of raw sensitive information_ is this:




Tightly aligned, low friction, reasonably secured sharing is key.




Requiring a dozen or more places to consume/share/interact is tantamount to making _busy people_ just move on without you.
