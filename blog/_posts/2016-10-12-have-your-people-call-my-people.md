For as long as I've been a professional worker, I've wondered why it is so hard
to get a group of individuals to agree to times and durations for meetings. Then
again, there is a case to be made for avoiding meetings if at all possible.

How's Tuesday Afternoon?
========================

You might remember the first time someone exposed you to the concept of _getting
things done_ and all the power this simple phrase promised to deliver. You
probably also remember when slap bracelets were a thing.

Indeed, even the proponents of so-called agile methodologies will impress upon
devotees (or anyone that will listen) that a standing meeting is a way to
physically exhaust attendees that might otherwise spend longer times in meetings
were they seated.

The Promise of Artificial Intelligence
======================================

Years from now, we will all look back at the marvel that wasn't AI but the
marvel that was marketing adoption of the term AI as the word to search and
replace for in copy that previously referred to _real time_, _social graph_, or
the latest darling _on demand_. So, does the hype match the execution?

Five years ago, Microsoft bought Skype. Now, I might know folks at both places
but this commentary is just me riffing. I'll just say that I had high hopes and
still do.

notification from someone named &quot;Clippy&quot; asking if they can help me
start a conference call? Sure. Why not? http://bit.ly/mgweck</p>&mdash; Gone

Alternatives To Waiting
=======================

I've hired virtual assistants before. The results were mixed.

I've tried various email this or click this web applications to generate quorum.
Again, the results were mixed.

I've tried the free versions of AI-ish or been involved with startups in pursuit
of serendipitous calendar integration. For most, results were mixed until the
results were no longer viable business models.

So, for now at least, I'm using a few alternatives while I await meeting
scheduling nirvana 

- [World Clock Meeting Planner](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html)
- [SunCalc](http://suncalc.net/)
- [World Time Buddy](http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/)
- [Time Zones](http://everytimezone.com/)
- [When2meet](http://www.when2meet.com/)
- etc...

Future Feature Parity
=====================

I've had access (and still have access) to executive assistants. Without a
doubt, people are just plain awesome if your business model permits. Further,
some might argue that people with executive assistant skills are exactly what
permits many modern business models to persist in the first place. 

It's easy to see why startups want to embody what an executive assistant can do
as machine learning models and selective task defintions. Once there is a
minimum viable product the next step seems to be a freemium to premium trial
ware approach. Or, the startup fails and is reconsumed into another startup. 

If only there was AI for pricing models. Actually, that probably exists
somewhere too. üòâ
