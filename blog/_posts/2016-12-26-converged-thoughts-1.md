Welcome to the first issue of my digest.

I know… an email newsletter on the eve of the year 2017. Bold! ;-)

Since 2007, I have shared content or links to content on micro blogging
platforms such as Twitter. Since the barrier to publish on Twitter is low, I’ve
been told by peers that Twitter can be hard to keep up with at times. 

Also, while I have a personal blog, my blog is updated infrequently and it
doesn’t show up in your inbox because I’ve resisted adding services like
FeedBurner and the like. So, this will be a newsletter and the format will be
that of a digest.

My goal for the digest is simple. I will go back to the items I share over the
course of a day or week and provide more context on why those items are of
interest.

The format for this issue and future issues will be as follows:

- My original pithy tweet and link to content described
-  few more notes on why this content is of interest

Let’s begin…

# Notifications Zero and Notifications Bankruptcy

If you know me then you know I tend to become infatuated with new tools for
 collaboration, sharing, and the like. Years ago these tools were referred to as
 groupware. Yes, I really liked Google Wave.
 
When I came across this Google Tech Talk from 2007 about “Inbox Zero” it was
 part of my quest to look back a decade or more for patterns and dated
 references. Here, looking back at the notion of getting things done using an
 email inbox as a means of workflow is a mix of nostalgia and frustration.
 
The nostalgia comes from remembering just how many emails you might have sent
 in your life or remembering an email that brings back a fond memory. You might
 even recall printing out an email and hanging it up as a memento of sorts. I
 know I did that.
 
The frustration comes from knowing that email is where good ideas or valuable
 information seem to be buried under updates that are of little value (not to be
 confused with this digest update!). Perhaps you are into the newer reboot of
 older interfaces like IRC or threaded message forums seen in the latest
 groupware such as Slack. Then again, perhaps you know others that won’t benefit
 from Slack because, for them, email is good enough – and that might be
 frustrating too.
 
Depending on when you began to use email, email inboxes became a digital
 equivalent for physical inboxes for postal mail. Spam was annoying until Gmail
 mostly stopped the worst of spam.
 
If you use a mobile version or a web browser version of tools like Slack it
 will be apparent that the new inbox is… notifications. At this point, I’ve
 taken to turning off email notifications and rely upon the visual
 notifications. Usually it is the red circle with a number that is meant to
 convey SOMETHING TO CLICK ON RIGHT NOW.
 
It’s no small wonder that there are already references to Notifications Zero
 and declaring Notifications Bankruptcy.
 
Ah, innovation…￼ meet the new inbox… same as the old inbox!
 
BTW, you can find me here on Slack clearing my notifications:
