As of this October update, I've been with Dell EMC (Converged) for seven years. [As I described last year](/my-sixth-year-at-vce/), the only reminder references to VCE nowadays is the 2012 era logo at the top of a pay stub. It's a testament to the execution of the integration as VCE references, and eventually EMC references, give way to Dell EMC references.

I started this post ten days ago. The year since my last work related update has been one of integration activity, organizational changes, departures, arrivals, epiphanies, and a fair number of trips.

The Road
========

While the past year has not been as travel intensive for me as in prior years (90% travel), there were some highlights and welcome changes. Of the 52 weeks since my last October update, I appear to have traveled ~30 of those weeks. So, 60-70% travel seems about right.

Highlights from the past 12 months include industry events such as Splunk .conf, Garther Data Center Conference, HIMMS, VMworld, and Gartner Symposium ITXPO. I was able to speak and conduct panels and meet with lots of partners and customers. Additionally, it seemed like each week brought multiple Executive Briefings in Hopkinton, Santa Clara and in Round Rock.

Changes (for the better!) included Delta adding direct routes from AUS to BOS. So much better than a connection! I haven't missed connecting through MSP and ATL since the direct route started.

The Topics
==========

Converged Infrastructure (CI) is now about as provocative as the status quo reference architectures it displaced several years ago. CI just works now and has fewer objections to overcome in IT landscapes where LAN and SAN connected compute/storage paradigms persist. For many companies, CI has meant a chance to free the cycles required for other aspects of digital transformation. It's an easy button.

That said, something changed in the last year or so. The single most requested topic of discussion was not converged infrastructure (CI). Nope. It was hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI).

The next most requested topic? Hybrid cloud -on- HCI. Basically, an operating model delivered on a software defined basis was the topic. Eventually, this become a topic named software defined operations or a similar string of terms to indicate less manual configuration of the low level infrastructure.

The Patent
==========

I've gone through the patent filing process before at other companies but never had a grant. Until now. As of June 20 2017, I can now link my first granted patent: [9684539][2293ae92]

  [2293ae92]: https://patents.google.com/patent/US9684539B1/en "Methods, systems, and computer readable mediums for logically remediating infrastructure resource components"

Previously, I was ambiguous about what Dell EMC would be working on for customers that I could write about on my blog. As it turns out, that has not changed. Dell EMC is part of Dell Technologies and the Marketing organization creates far more content than I ever could alone on a personal blog.

99% of what I create or share now is "behind the firewall" and that is fine. Th
