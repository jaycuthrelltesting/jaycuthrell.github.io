This is where I'll be putting my notes from VMworld 2010 and related Silicon Valley adventures.  The basic schedule I'll try to follow is below.  Primarily, I'm here for business but I will have some geek style fun along the way too.  A big highlight will be interacting with the startups at VMworld this year.  More notes will appear below as I am able to capture and refine my thoughts. :)  Also, if you got to this page you probably have my card.  Let's stay in touch!





In the meantime, I'm organizing my references to cloud computing, virtualization, data centers, data mining, applications, and technology trends for service providers and the enterprise﻿:

## Day 3 - Wednesday, September 1




Highlights: During the interview with Heineken, metrics shared around improvements in efficiency, performance, and management of data center operations will not lower the price of beer -- but shareholders will likely have more beer money as a result.  Yet, during the discussions around performance oriented business analytics the panel was not able to answer that specific question.  So, again we see that there may not be a flattening in all areas of business IT.




[




The use of Compellent was an obvious portion of the discussions but it was difficult to pin down a correlation that was direct. There were the obvious references to "hero" reports but the impact was in terms of storage purchasing and effective use (green pickup by powering down).




With VMware it is possible to have the IT customers enabled to clone, create, and test quickly vs. going through the previous (traditional) processes associated with responding to such a requirement.  The maturity of specific tiers of storage buckets was highlighted in that high performance (SSD) tiers are for HPC applications and then there is "other" that moves to SATA.




Through a line of questions it was determined that the arrival at differing allocation of storage was discovered through analysis of server load -- NOT through any automatic or so-called proactive feedback loop (PFL).  The leading question was to draw out a "do you want something that decides for you" but it appears that scenario might not have translated.
