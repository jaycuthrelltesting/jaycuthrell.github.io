Next month I'll reach my 3 year mark with VCE.

(In fact there is a tag just for VCE... [Three years of VCE] to be exact!)

The VCE rocketship has only continued to [accelerate] since I jumped on board. I'm consistently amazed at what VCE has been able to accomplish in this short amount of time. There is still much work to do but I am happy and fortunate to be part of the team. 

The vision from 2010 is the reality of 2013. Ubiquitous workload substrate and an everything just works data center world are not so much a destination but an ever advancing goal. Here's to the vision of 2014 and beyond. Combinatorial optimization FTW!!!

To that end, VCE is launching the next generation of market leading true converged infrastructure solutions on [September 17, 2013][accelerate].

More, more, more
----------------

In the more category I am spending even more time in VCE Customer meetings with VCE Partners lately. This is on top of increased VCE cross functional team velocity. That means conversations with lots and lots of new VCE Customers and returning to meet with repeat VCE Customers.

Since my last [timely] post a few things have been consuming my time away from this blog. 

- drumming up interest for my SxSW panel submission [A Wheel Of Pain: How I Learned To Love Enterprise][Wheel of Pain]
- there are a few [more places] I've been [publishing]
- spending quality time with [analysts]
- [whiteboard sessions] with really smart folks
- random [fun stuff] ;-)

Survey says: Buy a Vblock
-------------------------

What has been really great is seeing the wider audience of pundits, analysts, and the market realize that Vblock Systems from VCE are about accelerating the transformation that is taking place in the data center. In short -- buy a Vblock.

Here is a sample of what I mean in their own words:

> [What I appreciated most about Vblocks was that I didn't waste any time discussing storage, compute or network hardware.][it is easier to just buy Vblock] -- *SearchSDN*

> [What makes this fascinating to me is I don’t know any other vendor that does this as aggressively.][VCE's Strategic Advantage: Best of Breed Process] -- *Datamation*

> [That VCE is making so strong an impact in so short a time is a testimony to the uncommon quality of both its Vblock solutions and its market approach.][VCE: The New Digital Factory] -- *ITTNA*

> [With this new VCE partnership, we can now drop ship our private platform to customers and partners worldwide much faster so they can leverage its power and scalability to secure their IT infrastructures or those of their customers.][QualysGuard Private Cloud Platform] -- *Qualys*

> [Vblock has freed up time so they can put more effort and resources into custom applications and the things that are driving their business versus just keeping the lights on with infrastructure.][Converged Infrastructure Bets] -- *CRN*

> [Our strong partnership with VCE helps to ensure that enterprises can achieve these efficiencies that come from cross-platform integration and automation in their cloud infrastructure.][BMC Cloud on Vblock] -- *BMC*

> [Not only are EMC backup and recovery solutions pre-configured, pre-integrated, and pre-tested to work across all hardware and software components in the Vblock System, they also are built right into the VCE cabinetry with 10 Gig-E cable direct connects, so that setting up a secondary backup network is no longer necessary.][Data Protection Solutions] -- *Cisco*

> [It was a tall order, but by standardizing on the Vblock architecture and virtualizing applications our dedicated team of engineers and technicians were able to complete the initial Cloud Data Center build on schedule.][EMC Durham Data Center] -- *EMC*

> [Native integration of VCE innovative converged infrastructure systems with VMware's industry-leading management solutions will help our joint enterprise and service provider customers further simplify, automate and modernize management of their software-defined datacenter environments][VMware and VCE] -- *VMware*

> [A Vblock from VCE isn’t just a sum of its parts—it’s a new way of implementing and supporting mission-critical infrastructure. [...] The proof is in the customer base. VCE is currently enjoying a 70%+ reorder rate][ESG Report] -- *ESG*
