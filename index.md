### Personal Statement

Hi, I'm [Jay Cuthrell](http://www.linkedin.com/in/qthrul). As [Rob Base once said](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsxsyZqmmlQ)... "I'm not internationally known but I'm known to rock" well... in my case, an IP phone. I have been putting stuff up on fudge.org since 1997. Most of it was as serious as any other vanity website can hope to be. In 2008 it peaked and I reached the point where I felt I had been there and done that. For now, this is a [sparse](http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Acuthrell.com) reset [experiment](http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Afudge.org) in the study of [link rot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot) and the closed [robots.txt](http://fudge.org/robots.txt) applied to the [Internet Archive](http://archive.org). Thanks for all the fish! Check back in 10 years to see if anything is remotely relevant, interesting, or politically damaging.
