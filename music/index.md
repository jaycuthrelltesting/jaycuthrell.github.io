I have been noodling around with music since I was in high school. It all started with an air powered organ and having a piano around as a small child. I never had lessons other than to learn trombone. Now that I have a Mac and access to GB there is a much shorter path to me cranking out music. I like that. My 4 track days were such a pain! :)

Also, I don't have lyrics for anything I have up here and it's not often that the song lasts for more than 60 seconds... so maybe song isn't the right word... perhaps I would do better to call them jingles.

I've placed all these tracks on Soundcloud as well but an [audiojs][42cf1189] version is also available. Enjoy!

## As seen on the ill fated MP3.Com

I was fudge on mp3.com. mp3.com is no longer what mp3.com once was. I actually sold two CD's on mp3.com... one was to someone in Portugal (never did figure that one out) and *ahem*I bought one*ahem*. It's not like I bet my career on this. Still, it is a really fun diversion and I have been able to work with people I respect on their own projects. This is my nooding. Oh yeah, the mp3.com thing.... So, I did what any person with access to web hosting would do. I put up my music on my own server.
