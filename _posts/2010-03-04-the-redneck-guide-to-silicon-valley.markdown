[at the Lincoln in downtown Raleigh.  My presentation was "The Redneck Guide to Silicon Valley".




I had a lot of fun and kept up with the pace of 15 seconds per slide pretty well even if I did trip up a few times.  The format is a challenging one but that's the fun part too.




This was my slide deck....

View more [presentations](http://www.slideshare.net/) from [Jay Cuthrell](http://www.slideshare.net/qthrul).


















Controlling the mic most melodic was MC Zach Ward ([@zachward](http://twitter.com/zachward)).  Let's just say that MC [Zach Ward](http://zachward.com/) touched us all in ways that ranged from appropriate to slightly more appropriate while exhibiting the grace of a man in tights.  On the assist was the [#OurHashTag](http://www.ourhashtag.com/) team keeping it nailed down for all involved.  They even streamed it live and saved it for posterity (my presentation is at the 1:43 mark but watch em all!).
















The other Ignite presenters were an absolutely amazing bunch and it was an honor to share a stage with them.  They were in no particular order based on my mental notes:




[boldly went where no man has gone before... but probably should. And often.




Janet Kennedy ([@jkennedy93](http://twitter.com/jkennedy93)) gave us all pause to think about what a few cents mean and could mean to others.




David Millsaps ([@eyevariety](http://twitter.com/eyevariety)) of [New Raleigh](http://www.newraleigh.com/) made the case for hitting the books again and thinking about _social_ with that in mind.




Jess Commins ([@renewabelle](http://twitter.com/renewabelle)) made sure that everyone would think about caulk in ways that make a old man blush and a young man squeal.




Henry Copeland ([@hc](http://twitter.com/hc)) made sure we all knew that warts can kill startups.




Lisa Creech Bledsoe ([@glowbird](http://twitter.com/glowbird))  rocked the stage and convinced everyone to consider becoming a woman... a boxing woman.




Ryan Boyles ([@therab](http://twitter.com/therab)) detailed his plans to avoid skateboarding zombies along a post-apocalyptic path on the way to SxSW.




Evan Carroll ([@evancarroll](http://twitter.com/evancarroll)) explored what happens to your digital self when your real world self ends up in a flower pot.




Natasha Crawford ([@natashacrawford](http://twitter.com/natashacrawford)) convinced us to dip our pens in the home ink instead of the company ink.




Jay Dolan ([@jaydolan](http://twitter.com/jaydolan)) made the case for shutting the laptop, turning off the iphone, and following dreams instead of avatars.




Elizabeth Gardner ([@WRALweathergal](http://twitter.com/WRALweathergal)) humbled everyone attending with her relentless nap-free day serving up the new of localized precipitation and average kinetic energy.




Nadia Moffett ([@missncusa2010](http://twitter.com/missncusa2010)) showed us what it means to change lives by building relationships and being Miss NC!




Chris Moody ([@cnmoody](http://twitter.com/cnmoody)) highlighted where customer acceptance begins and bias ends in how you form a team of rock stars and the crucial entourage of dumb.




Charlotte Moore ([@cavaticat](http://twitter.com/cavaticat)) put forth the argument that a five letter word synonym for woman is **cylon** and there should be a massively multi-muliebrity meeting of minds.




Laurie Ruettimann ([@lruettimann](http://twitter.com/lruettimann)) finished strong with a hard hitting expose on the intricacies of gaming business social networking sites using tomcat tomfoolery.




George Smart ([@georgesmartTMH](http://twitter.com/georgesmartTMH)) showed us homes that created by artists for artists in residence and those that host them.




Bethany Smith ([@bethanyvsmith](http://twitter.com/bethanyvsmith)) opened strong with a second slide that said it all made everyone that followed her question the decks yet to be shared.




Dan Wilson ([@danwilson](http://twitter.com/danwilson)) delivered dry humor with a heaping helping of health wisdom and confirmed that 30 minutes is actually 30 minutes while confirming he should be run for State Treasurer.




Last but definitely no least -- a huge thanks to the VENUE, SPONSORS, and the VOLUNTEERS that made the night possible!




More added as I think of it... :)




Thanks Raleigh!  Thanks Ignite!
