My hope for making updates here more common has been running into the demands of publishing elsewhere for [VCE][1]. Yes, it has been a while so this post is going to be a summary of summaries.

# A Plan Comes Together

The past few days have been exciting for me in a variety of ways. One item that is very much public now is the launch of [Pivotal][2].

If you had told me in 2010 that it would be 2013 when I got to see my Slide 17 and Slide 19 view of the world to collide then I would have probably been skeptical. My hope was to be looking 5 years out into the future.



# Pull Requests Culture

If you have ever attempted to collaborate using documents, files, or other *save and send* approaches than you know how frustrating the world of Enterprise workplaces can be at times. Obviously, there is the notion of a corporate culture that might drive behaviours that lend to one person doing work while others chip in as permitted. What I mean is the tossing of a document back and forth without any semblance of revision tracking or use of available technology to promote a team effort and collective output.

But does it really have to be that way?

Perhaps you have seen the magic of simultaneous editing within Google Apps on a document or spreadsheet. Perhaps you recall the first time you saw Etherpad or the infamous Google Wave.

That's just a document though. What about applications that are not unlike your first ICQ chat or seeing the other person doing *something* on the other end of iMessage on their iPhone or multiplatform chat app. It's telegraphing the possibility of contribution. You are miles apart but working closely together in the moment.

But where do these modern applications live on the corporate desktop, laptop, and mobile endpoint?

Oh. That's right. All the smart kids are working on pokes, virtual farming, and BitCoin for Path Stickers mashups with $1B valuations.

Wait. That's not entirely true. In fact, I'd wager that there will be a huge number of consumer web kids that begin to find the world of revenue before the first billion users to be something worth their time and attention.

# Make It So

In order to realize the feature sets and enhancements that the past few years have seen in UX/UI, onboarding, social sharing, and teaming controls, etc. that pervade the consumer web world of startups -- there has to be a different kind of company and a different kind of approach to leveraging the prior art and best practices. This will be how the Enterprise world gains access to and provides traction for the next wave of startups that haven't been formed yet or that have not pivoted to Enterprise yet.

Consider that most of what runs in the legacy Enterprise IT world is decaying both in terms of new seats, alignment to consumer demand patterns, and generally complies to a paper to electronic improvement goal. Next, is the improvement of electronic to human factors goals. Now imagine those updates, fixes, enhancements, etc. done in a continuous and conspicuous manner through integration, interation, and deployment at the speed of whim based infrastructure.

# Ubiquitous Workload Substrate

To get to this vision -- everything just has to work. All that infrastructure stuff below the platform as a service (PaaS) layer has to be completely and utterly **BORING**.

Now who on Earth might be [thinking about that problem][3]...
