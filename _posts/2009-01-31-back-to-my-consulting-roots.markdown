After being a CTO since 2002 with [NeoNova](http://www.neonova.net) and [Digitel](http://www.digitel.net) the time has come to return to my _consulting roots_. I've had a great run as a technology leader with great people, great companies, and I've seen the beauty of rural America.

Having spent almost two years in Atlanta, GA I've re-relocated back to Research Triangle Park, NC in the East.Â  In addition, I have established a second office away from the office in Missoula, MT for trips to the West.

[Cuthrell Consulting](http://cuthrell.com) has engaged with several successful telecom companies and emerging technology firms that I've had the pleasure of working with over these past six years.

[

As you might imagine, I am also actively adding new clients that benefit from my expertise and strategic technology services.

Going forward, I'm going to be available at [cuthrell.com](http://cuthrell.com) and will be updating content there in the coming weeks.
