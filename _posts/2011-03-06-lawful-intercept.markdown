> Social network privacy concerns? Consider this: Lawful Intercept allows anyone to be monitored in real-time. [I saw what you did.](http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_IAP5956)


This year [I'll be speaking at SxSW](http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_IAP5956) in the _Greater Good_ track on Sunday March 13th at 11am Central in Room 10AB at the Austin Convention Center.

I hope to expand on my prior post [CALEA and Me](http://fudge.org/calea-and-me/) from 2007. Has it really been 4 years? The hash tag for my talk is [#ISWYD](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=+%23iswyd+since:2011-01-01). Below is a handy Twitter search widget to get things started.

Here's a sneak preview of my presentation:

**SxSW Interactive: Solo**

**Title: [Lawful Intercept: I Saw What You Did](http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_IAP5956)
**
Social network privacy concerns? Step back and consider this: Lawful Intercept (LI) is how all network users are able to be monitored and analyzed in real-time. While many are concerned with privacy on a popular website, LI empowers an elected or appointed authority to know our digital comings and goings around the clock. This presentation will highlight the latest in LI technology, LI challenges , and how each of us can shape future of how LI is perceived and used.
