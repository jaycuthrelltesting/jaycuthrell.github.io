[This month I reached my 10th year as a LiveJournal user.  I've posted 5,601 LiveJournal entries during that time.  I've received 8,839 comments.  I've made 11,053 comments.

I still recall my first post.  The ability to go back and see what you were up to on a particular day is a favorite of mine.  I remember pulling the custom minimal output into my own website as a sort of reverse chronological view into what I was up to at the time.
