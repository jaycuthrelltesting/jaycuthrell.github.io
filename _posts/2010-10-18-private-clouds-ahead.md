title: Private Clouds Ahead
---

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jcuthrell/11372017875/" title="acadia by qthrul, on Flickr"></a>

I have an announcement to make...




I have accepted a position with [Acadia](http://www.acadia.com/).




My new title is ﻿_Principal Technology Consultant_.




In my new role, I'll be helping companies realize and harness the full potential of private cloud solutions.




﻿At this point you might be asking, well, several things... so let's start with a F.A.Q.




_OMG! Are you on Team Edward or Team Jacob?!?!?!?!!!_


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jcuthrell/11372078794/" title="TeamJacobEdwardTrey by qthrul, on Flickr"></a>

> Great question! Twilight fans will be happy to know that I'll be reporting to [Trey Layton](http://www.ethernetstorageguy.com/), Sr. Director Worldwide Solution Architects at VCE / Acadia.  Team Trey will be pulling out all the stops to help customers design and implement technologies using the [Vblock](http://acadia.com/solutions/vblock/index.htm) portfolio from [VMware, Cisco & EMC](http://www.vcecoalition.com/).




> I'm still based in Research Triangle Park, NC and Missoula, MT but anyone that knows my background also knows [you can find me on the road traveling for customers](http://www.tripit.com/people/cuthrell.com) and [industry events](http://plancast.com/qthrul).  Of course, when I am back in the Triangle area I expect to get lots of quality stick time on the amazing environments here in the new Raleigh, NC office where Team Jonathan (Jonathan Donaldson) drives vertical solutions on the [Vblock](http://acadia.com/solutions/vblock/index.htm) architecture and performs customer facing engagements.




_Why join forces with VCE / Acadia?_


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jcuthrell/11372078854/" title="vanything_small by qthrul, on Flickr"></a>

>I'm going to be perfectly frank.  I think [Vblock](http://acadia.com/solutions/vblock/index.htm) architecture rocks.  Oh, you wanted more?  Well, as you may know, I have an affinity for startups, service providers, and investment groups.  Previously, I've been a CTO, VP, GM, Infrastructure Architect, and most recently an independent consultant with [my own consulting practice](http://fudge.org/back-to-my-consulting-roots/). During my career I've _been arm in arm with service providers_ as their data centers have evolved _and_ I've also _been the service provider_ experiencing that evolution first hand. Having sat on both sides of the table, this is an exciting time for me.




_What caused you to make this move?_




> Of course, [I'd known about Acadia](http://chucksblog.emc.com/chucks_blog/2009/11/introducing-acadia.html) and [I'd known about VCE](http://chucksblog.emc.com/chucks_blog/2009/11/announcing-the-vce-coalition.html) for a while. I had formed some early opinions... lots of opinions.  I did my research.  I attended conferences.  I talked shop with my trusted peers.  I met and spoke with folks within the VCE / Acadia organization.  
  

Then I made my move.




> 
Side note: You'd be _amazed_ at how effective blaring Peter Gabriel's "In Your Eyes" from the parking lot under an executive briefing area can be.




> One last interesting factoid: As it turns out, I am often updating [CrunchBase](http://crunchbase.com) with new companies I come across in my travels here and there (I'm still the top non-TC contributor as of this blog post btw... *flex*).  One of those bold new ventures I came across was VCE / Acadia.  The competitive leader board side of me realized that there wasn't an entry for Acadia in Crunchbase. So, I fixed that.

_Why get involved with private cloud now?_


![Gartner Says...](http://na1.www.gartner.com/hc/images/205757_0001.gif;pv9d072dbc6f378af8)


_Are you hiring?_




> Yes! vSuperheroes in the house! [Acadia is growing](http://acadia.com/careers/index.htm) a number of teams.  You'll want to [start by reviewing this entry from Chad Sakac](http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/virtual_geek/2010/09/more-than-200-open-positions-at-emc-emc-partners-and-vce.html) since it... well, you'll just have to read it! [Enjoy](http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/virtual_geek/2010/09/more-than-200-open-positions-at-emc-emc-partners-and-vce.html)! There are many ways to contact me but [reach out to me via Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/qthrul) if you see a fit and I will do my best to route you to the right channels.

_Where should Cuthrell Consulting, LLC service provider and infrastructure clients go now?_




> I'm still [here](http://cuthrell.com) and now you have a trusted advisor within [Acadia](http://www.acadia.com/).  Let's chat!




_What about the other guest blog and writing you do elsewhere?_




> I'm hopeful my time management skills will permit me to reach out on subjects I'm known for writing about beyond fudge.org. I am extremely grateful to the folks at [Telecompetitor](http://telecompetitor.com) and [ReadWriteWeb](http://readwriteweb.com) for giving me amazing platforms and the opportunity to share my views on a wide variety of topics.  In short, I hope to continue my contributions as time permits and demand dictates.




_Does this mean fudge.org becomes a corporately controlled blog?_




> Nope. I'll be updating my [disclosure](http://fudge.org/disclosure/) statement to be less terse and adding some pertinent boilerplate which will make it even more boring.  Again, this blog will always be 100% USDA certified Jay Cuthrell aka [@qthrul](http://twitter.com/qthrul).   I'll be writing about things I care about.  That won't ever change. Hey, maybe Friday Fudge will come back into regular circulation again. We shall see.





_Speaking of [@qthrul](http://twitter.com/qthrul)... Does this mean [@qthrul](http://twitter.com/qthrul) on Twitter becomes a corporately controlled Twitter account?_




> Nope. I'll be updating my bio line for [@qthrul](http://twitter.com/qthrul) to reflect pretty much whatever fits into a form element.  "I fill out web forms" has served me well so far.  Due to the nature of how Twitter functions as a connected API accessible medium, I can only say that my tweets will always be 99.999% USDA certified Jay Cuthrell.   One of my favorite replies on Twitter has to be (parphrased) "Jay, I understand about 1 out of every 7 things you tweet".  It's a good bet my tweets will be as geeky and random as ever.  Twitter is a limited engagement medium of course so the longer format of blogs and extraneous append/edit models of Google Buzz are better for protracted discussion.





Thus concludes the F.A.Q. portion of this post.
